## Current Project: Live Count Application ðŸš€

I'm currently diving into **Elixir** and building a **live count application** that displays the number of users watching or interacting in real-time. This project allows me to explore Elixir's powerful **concurrency** model and take advantage of lightweight processes.

Planned features include:
- Real-time user count updates
- Efficient handling of concurrent connections
- Hosting on a **Raspberry Pi Zero**
